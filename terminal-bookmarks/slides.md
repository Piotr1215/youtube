# Terminal and Neovim Bookmark Manager

```bash
~~~just intro_toilet Bookmark Manager
  
~~~
```

---

## Why Bookmarks?

- Access to files and directories everywhere in the terminal
- List in plain text
- Easy edit, save, backup, version

---

## The Problem

> "Bookmarks are not easy to find"

> "I have separate workflows for terminal and editor"

> "I'm tired of typing the same paths over and over"

---

- Terminal/tmux sessions
