Neovim has a terminal. Most people ignore it. That's a mistake.

The terminal buffer isn't just a shell window—it's a buffer. You can yank from it. Search it. Jump between prompts. Navigate with text objects.

This video covers:
- What libvterm actually does
- OSC sequences (how shell talks to terminal)
- Custom commands: :T, :VT, :R
- Executing scripts without leaving the editor
- Jumping between prompts with ]] and [[

No plugins required. Just built-in features you're not using.
