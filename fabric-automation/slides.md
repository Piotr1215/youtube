## Introduction

- What is Fabric AI? 🧵
  > Fabric, by Daniel Miessler, simplifies AI integration using modular "Patterns"
  > It's customizable via command-line, GUI, or voice.
- What is Prompts Automation? 🔄
  > Prompts help us encapsulate directions to AI tools

---

## Creating Prompts Easier 🛠️

- use `claude` prompt generator 🤖
- use `improve_prompt` with fabric 🧰
- prompt snippets (using AutoKey on Linux or others on different OS) ⌨️

---

## Making it Usable ✨

- easily inject additional context with `vipe` and `nvim` 📝
- prompts chaining with `fabric` sessions 🔗
- select prompts easily with `fzf` 🔍
- output into neovim ✍️

---

## Demo 🎬

- writing out own automation script 📜
- we need:
  - `fabric` 🧵
  - `fzf` 🔍
  - `vipe` (moreutils) 📊
  - `nvim` (obviously ;)) 🖋️
