Never Miss Terminal Prompts Again: Tmux Auto-Notifications

A file-based notification system for monitoring terminal applications across multiple tmux sessions. This approach uses shell scripts and Unix tools to automatically detect when applications like Claude AI require input, eliminating the need to constantly check different sessions.

The system implements a distributed architecture using file-based queues, providing reliable notifications without race conditions or timing issues. All components are built with standard Unix utilities and open source tools.

What's covered:
- Terminal output monitoring with tmux pipe-pane
- Pattern-based detection of application prompts
- File-based notification queues with atomic operations
- Menu bar integration using Argos
- Keybinding automation for session switching

Key features:
- No missed prompts across sessions
- Self-cleaning notification files
- No proprietary dependencies
- Fault-tolerant design
