I need your help editing a file called 'exercise' in the current directory.

TASK: Extract and format structured data from unstructured text

This involves:
1. Identifying key-value pairs in a document
2. Extracting headers and section titles
3. Converting the extracted information into a structured format
4. Organizing the data in a logical, hierarchical manner

You can:
- Use 'cat exercise' to view the current file
- Use the Edit function to modify the file
- Run the commands multiple times to check your progress

ONLY if you are completely stuck or if explicitly permitted by the user:
- Use 'diff exercise /home/decoder/dev/youtube/user-vs-ai/exercises/05.text-extraction/solution | cat' to see differences

Please help me transform this file step by step based on your understanding of data extraction and structuring. Focus on applying your knowledge rather than looking at the solution.
