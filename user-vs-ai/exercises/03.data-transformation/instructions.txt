I need your help editing a file called 'exercise' in the current directory.

TASK: Convert CSV product data to JSON

This involves:
1. Converting the CSV data to a properly formatted JSON array of objects
2. Preserving all field names exactly as they appear in the CSV
3. Converting numeric values (product_id, price_usd, stock_count) to numbers (not strings)
4. Ensuring proper JSON indentation for readability

You can:
- Use 'cat exercise' to view the current file
- Use one of the commands above to convert the file
- Run the commands multiple times to check your progress

ONLY if you are completely stuck or if explicitly permitted by the user:
- Use 'diff exercise /home/decoder/dev/youtube/user-vs-ai/exercises/03.data-transformation/solution | cat' to see differences

Please help me transform this file. Focus on applying your knowledge rather than looking at the solution.
