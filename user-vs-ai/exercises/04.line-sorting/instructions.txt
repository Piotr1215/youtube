I need your help editing a file called 'exercise' in the current directory.

TASK: Organize functions by category and alphabetically within each category

This involves:
1. Identifying the different categories marked by comments (ADMIN FUNCTIONS, USER ACTIONS, etc.)
2. Grouping all functions under their appropriate category headers
3. Sorting functions alphabetically within each category
4. Preserving the overall comment structure and formatting
5. Maintaining each function's implementation exactly as is

The categories should appear in this order:
1. ADMIN FUNCTIONS
2. SYSTEM UTILITIES
3. USER ACTIONS
4. VALIDATION FUNCTIONS

You can:
- Use 'cat exercise' to view the current file
- Use the Edit function to modify the file
- Run the commands multiple times to check your progress

ONLY if you are completely stuck or if explicitly permitted by the user:
- Use 'diff exercise /home/decoder/dev/youtube/user-vs-ai/exercises/04.line-sorting/solution | cat' to see differences

Please help me transform this file step by step based on your understanding of code organization principles. Focus on applying your knowledge rather than looking at the solution.
