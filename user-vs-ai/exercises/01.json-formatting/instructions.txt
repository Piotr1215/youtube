I need your help editing a file called 'exercise' in the current directory.

TASK: Convert Python dictionary to properly formatted JSON with correct indentation

This involves:
1. Fixing Python-style booleans (True/False) to JSON format (true/false)
2. Adding proper JSON indentation with 2 spaces
3. Formatting nested arrays and objects properly
4. Ensuring all JSON syntax is valid

You can:
- Use 'cat exercise' to view the current file
- Use the Edit function to modify the file
- Run the commands multiple times to check your progress

ONLY if you are completely stuck or if explicitly permitted by the user:
- Use 'diff exercise /home/decoder/dev/youtube/user-vs-ai/exercises/01.json-formatting/solution | cat' to see differences

Please help me transform this file step by step based on your understanding of proper JSON formatting. Focus on applying your knowledge rather than looking at the solution.
