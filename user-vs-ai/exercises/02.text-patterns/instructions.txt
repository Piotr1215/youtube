I need your help editing a file called 'exercise' in the current directory.

TASK: Standardize phone number formats in a contact list

This involves:
1. Identifying different phone number formats in the text
2. Converting all formats to the standard XXX-XXX-XXXX format
3. Ensuring all parentheses, dots, and spaces are removed
4. Maintaining the 555 area code in all numbers

You can:
- Use 'cat exercise' to view the current file
- Use the Edit function to modify the file
- Run the commands multiple times to check your progress

ONLY if you are completely stuck or if explicitly permitted by the user:
- Use 'diff exercise /home/decoder/dev/youtube/user-vs-ai/exercises/02.text-patterns/solution | cat' to see differences

Please help me transform this file step by step based on your understanding of phone number formatting. Focus on applying your knowledge rather than looking at the solution.
