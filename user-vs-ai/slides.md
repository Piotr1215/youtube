# User vs AI: The Text Editing Battle 🥊

```bash
~~~just intro_toilet User vs AI

~~~
```

---

## Introduction

- 🤖 AI's strengths in context-aware text operations
- 🧩 Human tools' power in structured syntax manipulation
- ⚔️ Head-to-head challenges in real-world tasks
- 🔍 Analysis of which approach shines in different scenarios
- 💡 Practical takeaways for your editing workflow

---

## The Contenders 🥊

**AI Assistant**                      **Human with Tools**
- Has read the entire internet        - Has several browser tabs open
- Never sleeps                        - Fueled by coffee and stackoverflow
- Speaks multiple languages           - Knows bash one-liners by heart
- Doesn't get angry at bugs           - Learned vim, can't exit
- Types 5000 words per minute         - Has a mechanical keyboard

---

## Why This Matters 🤔

> Knowing when to use each approach can dramatically improve your productivity

- AI excels at:               *semantic understanding*
- Human tools excel at:       *structured transformations*
- Together they form:         *a powerful toolkit*

## The Challenge Format

For each challenge, we'll:

1. Present a text editing task
2. Show AI attempting the task
3. Show the human approach to the same task
4. Compare results and efficiency
5. Discuss the strengths of each approach

---

## Our Five Challenges

1. **JSON Formatting**: Transforming Python to structured JSON
2. **Phone Number Formatting**: Standardizing various phone number formats
3. **Data Transformation**: Converting CSV data to formatted JSON with rules
4. **Code Organization**: Sorting functions by category and alphabetically
5. **Text Extraction**: Creating structured content from raw text

## Augmentation vs Replacement

- **non-blackbox programming**: Augmentation model
- **blackbox programming**: Replacement

---

## Key Takeaways 💡

- AI augments rather than replaces human capabilities ... for now
- Complementary strengths create powerful workflows
- Use tools, snippets and automation for repetitive tasks, it's still faster
- Use AI tooling for context related, unstructured text generation/manipulation
