10 Neovim features hiding in plain sight. No plugins. No config changes. Just keystrokes.

Most Neovim users install plugins for things already built-in. Shell filters, multi-cursor editing, incremental search preview—all there since Vim 7.

This video covers:
- Shell filter (! and !!) - pipe text through any Unix tool
- Visual block increment (g Ctrl-a) - generate numbered sequences
- Global command (:g/pattern/cmd) - bulk operations on matching lines
- Command-line registers (Ctrl-r) - insert registers in : or / prompts
- Normal on selection (:'<,'>norm) - multi-cursor without plugins
- Navigation jumps (gi, g;, gv) - jump to last insert, change, selection
- Auto-marks (`. `" `[ `]) - positions Vim tracks for you
- Command history window (q:) - edit and re-run commands
- Live substitution preview (inccommand) - see regex results before executing
- Copy/move lines (:t and :m) - duplicate without touching registers

Works in vanilla Neovim. Works in Vim. Works today.
