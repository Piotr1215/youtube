1. **Set your editor**: Ensure `$EDITOR` environment variable is set:
   ```bash
   export EDITOR=nvim  # or vim, code, etc.
   ```

2. **Browse workflow**: Use `just browse` as your main entry point, then:
   - Preview presentations with Enter
   - Edit with Ctrl-E if you need to make changes
   - Present with Ctrl-P when ready

3. **Search + Edit**: The search command is perfect for making quick edits:

   # Press Ctrl-E on any result to jump directly to that line
   ```

4. **Chaining commands**: Combine with other just recipes:
   ```bash
   just preview cv-pipeline  # Review content
   cd cv-pipeline && just present  # Then present
   ```
